## User Testing Qualitative Data

### User #1 (Nurse)
1. Use Descriptive Tab: Can you find how many Alzheimer's patients are registered?
- It says total patients and not registered patients but if that is the same it was very easy.

2. Use Descriptive Tab: Determine the distribution of Alzheimer's Disease patients by both gender and age
- First I thought it was age and gender together, but for them seppratley it was very easy :)

3. Use the Diagnosis Tab: Does Alzheimer's disease diagnosis correlate with MMSE, ADL or age?
- I found it hard to se the actual number first, but once I did it was good.

4. give us some feedback on what went well and on what could be improved
- I think you have done a great job! I just wonder why if you only use very few features to predict (which is enough btw), why do you have so many features included in the diagnostic and descriptive? Are they relevant? Overall, I think it was easy to use and navigate on. Specific tasks were a little bit harder, but it always is as a first time user. Great job!

### User #2 (Nurse)
1. Use the Diagnosis Tab: Does Alzheimer's disease diagnosis correlate with MMSE, ADL or age?
- It was easy to see if the correlation was true or false, but hard to interpret the scale. Is boxplot the best visualization for this purpose?

2. Use Diagnosis Tab: Can you identify a clear pattern on Alzheimer's Disease clustering?
- For a nurse or healthcare professional it's quite hard language. I'm having a hard time to interprate the patter and the words, for example: "Categorical Variable Correlation Analysis" (I mean I know it since I study this master, but I think a healthcare professional would have a hard time understanding).

### User #3 (Nurse)
1. Finally, give us some feedback on what went well and on what could be improved
- Everything works well. Easy to use. Informative and precise. Good work.

### User #4 (Physician)
1. Use Descriptive Tab: Can you find how many Alzheimer's patients are registered?
- The total number is a bit little. I tried to summarize the counts (male and female) at first.

2. Use Descriptive Tab: Determine the distribution of Alzheimer's Disease patients by both gender and age
- I thought it was gender grouped by age first.

3. Use Diagnosis Tab: Can you identify a clear pattern on Alzheimer's Disease clustering?
- Performed well. But I need to find “clustering”.

4. Finally, give us some feedback on what went well and on what could be improved
- There’s no shap graph or analytics when I operated.

### User #5 (Physician)
1. Finally, give us some feedback on what went well and on what could be improved
- Complete the shap analysis, looking forward to see it.
- I'm not sure if it's too bothered to train a model onlt based on 2 features.

### User #6 (IT)
1. Use Descriptive Tab: Can you find how many Alzheimer's patients are registered?
- It is mention the Total Patients: 760 however this not necessarily means patients with Alzheimer
2. Use the Diagnosis Tab: Does Alzheimer's disease diagnosis correlate with MMSE, ADL or age?
- It is straightforward steps. it took some time to understand that you need to scroll a bit down to perform this task
3. Use the Predictive Tab: predict the Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis for a new patients, using different values for ADL and MMSE
- Easy to perform, however, I don't understand the need to enter the patient's name since it will not help in the prediction.
4. Finally, give us some feedback on what went well and on what could be improved
- It is simple and easy to use dashboard. in the landing page I did not see the need to add the two images, since they are linked to no other pages. In my opinion a contact person should be added into the about page in case there is an issue within the system
