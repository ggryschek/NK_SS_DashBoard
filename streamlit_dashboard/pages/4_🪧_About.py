# Business Problem
st.markdown("### Business Problem")
st.write("""
To enhance care for Alzheimer's patients, data from NK will be used to gain insight into the disease. The business need will focus on early detection of the disease and risk prevention, to enhance personalized care, and optimize the resources used. The following areas will enhance early detection, optimize resources, and provide a more person-centered care.
""")

## Detail of business probelem
st.markdown("#### Early detection of the disease and risk prevention")
st.write("""
The predictive models will be able to foresee an Alzheimer's diagnosis, making it easier for health care workers to identify risk patients, which can lead to earlier treatment plans and better patient outcomes.
""")

st.markdown("#### Enhance personalized care")
st.write("""
By combining different features with each other based on patient data, more tailored correlations can arise, which can lead to a more person-centered and more effective treatment plan. This can also lead to a higher chance of patient satisfaction.
""")

st.markdown("#### Optimizing resources")
st.write("""
By becoming more familiar with the patient group and its correlations, resources will be able to be distributed more efficiently, and the patient flow will be able to increase without affecting the quality of care. This is achieved through better optimization of personnel resources and reduction of unnecessary costs.

# Dataset Description
st.markdown("### Dataset Description")
st.write("""
Neurologisk Klinik has compiled a synthetic and anonymized dataset [1] with detailed health information for 2,149 patients, each identified by a unique ID. The dataset contains various types of data, including demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, and symptoms.
The original dataset can be retrieved from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset) [1]

# Justification for Alzheimer's Patients clinical data
st.markdown("### Justification for Alzheimer's Patients Clinical Data")
st.write("""
Emerging evidence indicates that dementia shares several modifiable risk factors with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These include physical inactivity, obesity, tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension during mid-life. Additionally, certain risk factors more closely linked to dementia are social isolation, low educational attainment, cognitive inactivity, and mid-life depression [2].

Mitigating exposure to these modifiable risk factors at both the individual and population levelsâ€”starting from childhood and continuing throughout lifeâ€”can enhance individualsâ€™ and communitiesâ€™ abilities to make healthier choices and adopt lifestyle patterns that promote overall well-being [3-5].

# Disclaimer
st.markdown("#### Disclaimer")
st.write("""
The limited availability of real-world data poses significant challenges to development and innovation in the medical field. Given the sensitivity of medical data, using real patient information introduces privacy risks and regulatory concerns. By leveraging synthetic data, we can effectively mitigate these concerns, ensuring compliance with patient confidentiality and data protection regulations.
Once the initial testing and development are complete, the dashboard will be validated using real patient data provided by NK. This approach allows us to develop a reliable system in an ethical manner while being prepared to refine the system with real-world data later.
