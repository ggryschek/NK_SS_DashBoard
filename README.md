# NK Dashboard

## Introduction

To enhance care for Alzeimers patientâ€™s, data from NK will be used to gain insight in the disease. The business need will focus on early detection of the disease and risk prevention, to enhance personalized care, and optimize the resources used. The following areas will enhance early detection, optimize resources and provide a more person-centered care. 

#### Early detection of the disease and risk prevention

The predictive models will be able to foresee an Alzheimer's diagnosis, making it easier for health care workers to identify risk patients,  which can lead to earlier treatment plans and better patient outcomes. 

#### Enhance personalized care

By combining different features with each other based on patient data, more tailored correlations can arise, which can lead to a more person-centered and more effective treatment plan. This can also lead to a higher chance of patient satisfaction.

#### Optimizing resources

By becoming more familiar with the patient group and its correlations, resources will be able to be distributed more efficiently and the patient flow will be able to increase without affecting the quality of care. This through a better optimization of personnel resources and reduction of unnecessary costs.
